Chapter 1

Little Jane trenched across the rough dirt. With her bare hands she dug holes, seeping
through the dirt and scoping, looking for a certain something. Little Jane was taking part in an
activity for Girl Scouts. She was different from the other girls and would be bullied because she
was unique from the others. Everyone would kneel and praise the government, because they felt
like they had no choice, but she knew what they were doing was wrong. If Little Jane would
obey the government’s orders, she’s part of the problem. But unfortunately for her, everyone else
didn’t budge. They saw the rebel in her and would keep away from her presence because they
didn’t want to get in trouble.
